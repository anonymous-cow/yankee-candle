Blairfilm At Gmail,"Size: Medium Perfect Pillar,Style: Christmas Cookie,Pattern Name: Candle",5.0 out of 5 stars,I love candles so much that most every day I'm either ...,"
  Yankee Candle Company candles used to see so high priced to be before I began buying candles. I love candles so much that most every day I'm either enjoying a fragrant candle or wishing I'd ordered more. Less expensive candles burn fast and often leave a black stain on the ceiling above. Or when you put them out you'll see dark smoke that kind of makes you wonder if burning candles is a smart thing to do for your living environment. The minute I began buying these Yankee Candle Company candles I realized they burn very clean and burn for about three times the length of a traditional brand. I bought 3 of these and my large apartment smells like a Christmas cookie but not so strong that the sweetness is overwhelming. I love to relax in bed, with my dog, Logan, at my side, and enjoy the beauty, fragrance and relaxation that only Yankee candle delivers always. If you can find these on sale and if the ratings are great then you should be making a purchase right now. I hope this helps. I don't receive anything in return for a review. Just a happy camper with these candles. And I'm a dude!

  Dissatisfied purchase. All Yankee Candle products I have bought in the past have been fantastic, however, these particular candles gave off relatively no scent. Would compare it to a cheap Walmart brand candle and wouldn’t recommend.

S. Dial,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Balsam & Cedar,Pattern Name: Candle",1.0 out of 5 stars,Smelled Bad,"
  I purchased three of these candles for my aunt (who is located in a different state across the country from where I live) who has severe mobility issues and wears a colostomy bag as a result of cancer treatment. She requested good quality & good smelling candles to help with the smell when she and her caregiver change her bag. I purchased the Balsam & Cedar, Lavender and Sparkling Cinnamon candles thinking that each would offer a pleasant and varied aroma depending on her mood. She was excited to receive the package and quickly tried each of the candles. Both she and her caregiver remarked that all three of the candles smelled ""cheap"", they said that ""they smell like Lysol"" and they're reminiscent of ""dollar store quality candles"". I am exceedingly disappointed. I expect more from Yankee Candle (a brand that I've personally used in my own home and normally have a high opinion of), I expect better quality for candles that cost more than $10 each. At the very least I expect for each of the candle aromas to be distinguishable from one another. Now my aunt is stuck with three terrible smelling candles that she won't use, and I think we can all agree that the situation must be bad if you prefer the smell of human waste to a product designed to freshen the air.

Shanetx,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Home For The Holidays,Pattern Name: Candle",1.0 out of 5 stars,Its too bad.,"
  I have been burning this fragrance since it came out around 1994. It was the strongest and most beautifully blended Christmas scent that Yankee had put out. I would let it burn during the season and it fill my home with the smells of the season. The label was the most festive next to the Christmas Eve label that you could find from Yankee. Then they changed the Label before the latest change it slowly but since the label change the fragrance was never the same.  It became more of a metallic scent and did not have the depth it did for all the years. It seemed like it had been watered down. The most recent pours have been just a ghost of what it once was. I miss burning it during the holidays and have stopped buying it after 20 years of wonderful Christmases.  Im sorry all the people now buying it that give it 5 stars didn't know the beautiful seasonal scent it once was. But I guess Im glad that it is still purchased. Just wish it was the way it use to be.

Sandi,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Balsam & Cedar,Pattern Name: Candle",1.0 out of 5 stars,A candle must be smelled in person to be sure it is what you expect in a scent.,"
  I bought this thinking I'd have the faint pine scent of a real tree in the house for Christmas.  There were so many glowing reviews and Yankee candles have a good reputation, so I didn't think I could go wrong.  Admittedly, my husband has a sensitivity to smells, but he was right on this one - it didn't have that fresh pine smell.  It reminded me of the car air fresheners of old that people used to hang on their rear view mirrors.  It is much too strong - and not really the mild pine scent I had anticipated.  I gave it to a friend who wanted to try it and told her to donate it if she found they didn't like the scent.

KatyKatMidwest,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Christmas Cookie,Pattern Name: Candle",4.0 out of 5 stars,Where is the scent? Very weak. Old candles??,"
  First, please know I am a huge Yankee Candle fan. They are my go-to for candles.,That being said, I wondered why the Christmas Cookie candle has been such a great price. I ordered one, since I was out of holiday scents. The one I got just was not very powerful.,I am not sure if these are just very old stock, or perhaps seconds. Normally, these fill the room with their wonderful scents. With the one I received, you can tell a candle is burning, but you'd never guess the scent (either while burning or after extinguishing it). Very different from my other YC items.,So, just know that the price is great, but it might not be a bargain. It's still a nice looking candle; it just falls very short of what I have come to expect from Yankee Candle.

RUCTF,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Mistletoe,Pattern Name: Candle",2.0 out of 5 stars,Yankee Candles just aren’t any good anymore.,"
  For a Yankee Candle, and the price I paid, I was very disappointed. The smell was non-existent. I thought Yankee were once the best? Apparently greed must have killed them like it does so many businesses these days. You get people running the biz that want to start using cheaper quality materials to make more profit, and they raise prices to ridiculous levels because people love their products. Only they don’t realize people aren’t as stupid as they hoped. The people begin to realize that they just aren’t as good as they once were and they are WAY out of the ballpark now for the Quality to Cost ratio. So people try another brand and go wow, that’s a great candle! And they never go back. They then talk to their friends about it and the friends “wake up” and go “your right, their candles just aren’t that great anymore. Their prices have gotten ridiculous anyway.” It is now that they switch too over to that other brand that really knows how to make a great smelling candle, that stays smelling great, until the last bit of life leaves the flame on the wicks.,I know for a fact that this happens as stated above. It is from direct experiences on my part, multiple times as well. I even started polling our friends and the majority of them actually verified the same sentiment. That Yankee Candles, which used to be everyone’s favorite,  have gone downhill so badly and have gotten so crazy expensive, that it just does not make sense to keep wasting the amount of time I have to work to pay for them. I work hard. I want quality for my money and time. I’m not going to spend an hour working to throw away on garbage. Companies don’t respect the people who work to pay their salaries. The only thing they care about is my money and not the time I slaved at work just to purchase their crappy product. What happened to the days when “customers come FIRST”? They’re gone and now it’s only about taking your money/time and passing it on to the fat executive that’s destroying their brand, just to make themselves and their greedy shareholders fatter and richer off the backs of those who do the REAL work in this world.... just for the privilege of buying their overpriced trinkets.

It has a single wick and the top of the jar is slightly tapered, so this may hinder that, I don't know. It doesn't smoke if you start with a slightly trimmed wick before lighting it, but I wouldn't call it smokeless. That would make it ideal. I got a great price after the holidays so I can't complain.

  I've owned this Yankee Candle fragrance previously and loved, it as it smelled like fresh cut Christmas tree and not pine floor cleaner.  We have an artificial tree and my husband still wants the aroma he remembers from his childhood.  I don't know what went wrong with this batch of candles but they don't fill the room with the lovely scent my previous Yankee Candle purchases have.  You virtually have to stand right next to it to smell it.  Jokes on me because I bought two of them thinking I would use one and have one at the ready.

Coloratura Kiki,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Red Apple Wreath,Pattern Name: Candle",4.0 out of 5 stars,Could Have Had a Stronger Scent,"
  I like candles, especially on dark winter evenings, and even in Southern California, it gets chilly in the evenings, and of course our winter nights are long.,I bought two of these large candles: Balsam and Cedar and Red Apple Wreath. (Wish I'd gotten Christmas Cookie.) To me, the Balsam and Cedar is the stronger smelling, but it smells a little more like soap than like a forest or a Christmas tree! The Red Apple Wreath has a lovely scent, but it would have been nice if the scent were a little stronger.,The candles do last quite a long time, and thankfully, they burn clean. No nasty dark marks on ceilings or walls. That is a very important point to me. I like the containers, but these candles are so large that you really need a barbecue lighter to light them once they burn down low.,Overall, very nice candles that would have been perfect five stars had the scent been up to par, but it just wasn't. This is especially true of my favorite of the two, the Red Apple Wreath. It's so difficult to find a really good scented candle today, and, sadly, these don't really rise to the occasion. Almost, but not quite. I will definitely use them, but I'm disappointed in the lack of a stronger scent.

  I have looked at every Yankee Candle Co. seller, from Bed, Breakfast and Beyond to my local department store which carries a large candle department without success, for the Bayberry Candle that my mother always burned during the holiday season when I was growing up, and also, I burned for many years..however apparently the scent has become less popular for the ONLY place I found it was at the Yankee Candle Co itself thru Amazon.,I was hoping to purchase several candles at a lower price during the Black Friday sales...but I simply couldn't locate this specific scent.,I ended up paying full price..so I bought 3 of the, in hopes of having one to start 2017 holiday season with.,I love this scent..it brings back so many childhood memories and I'm sure it will for my adult kids also..wish I could afford to buy one for each of my family members but at $28.00 per candle, it's too much of a cost just for a 'nice scent'.,I wish Yankee Candle Co would distribute this classic holiday scent to the stores again.

  I must say I had no issues with the delivery or the condition of the glass jar or the candle.  Packed well and the candle was in perfect condition for immediate use.  No issues with the wick and the scent is not overpowering but is true to being outdoors surrounded by pine trees. Coming from New England, that is a real compliment to those who create the Yankee Candle scents.  I purchased two as the price offered by Amazon was a good deal and much less than the retain store or the online store.  I checked both and decided to go with Amazon as the online Yankee was overwhelmed and not able to process at two attempts my order and the retail store was low on inventory considering the late date of my purchasing.  I was fortunate to have received on Christmas Eve with no delays in delivery, this is where Prime membership is worth having.  Both candle jars came in their own individual packed box and both boxes were wrapped in a cardboard cushioned cover to protect the glass from breakage in travel than placed into a larger box.  I would definitely recommend and give as a gift.

  Idk if these are old or didn’t pass quality control but there is no where near the scent of the ones about in store (balsam and cedar). I bought rose and lilac and those are fine. This one smokes a lot when you first start burning it, and normally you can get the smell to permeate the whole room just opening it up unlit, but even after burning it is  lac lister. Bought here because the stores were all sold out, and this normally smells like a candle my grandmother had out every Christmas so I really look forward to this smell every year to help keep those memories alive.

  This is one of my favorite candles to buy around the holiday season. It smells strongly of balsam and cedar, but it's not overpowering. I buy this every season and off-season if available.

  I love everything about this candle, from the smell, to the price to the longevity of it.  The only thing I do not like and the reason why I subtracted one star is that the wick creates a lot of soot!  I mean, a little is understandable, but this is A LOT of soot!  So much so, that the top of the candle gets black every time I light it and I have noticed soot adheres to my walls and everything on that room too.  I still light the candle, but it is less frequent than before.  The soot ruins my enjoyment of it because I keep worrying about wiping everything clean.

  This is a great smelling candle! Reminds me of baking homemade sugar cookies. The scent isn’t too strong, which I appreciate because overly scented candles tend to give me a headache. The scent is really soft, and nostalgic. I’ve been burning the candle for around 12 hours a day, for a week, and it barely made a dent in the candle. I was very pleased with the packaging - it was packed in a thick cardboard material, around the whole candle, and I’ve had quite a few things break in the past, but this was very protected. I’ve been buying a lot of my candles from small businesses, which I’m enjoying, but it was nice to get a Yankee Candle, because those were all my mom would burn when I was younger, so like I said, it was very nostalgic. All in all - great price, greaty product, amazing scent, slow burning, the packaging was remarkable, and I would definitely recommend purchasing this candle.

  Christmas Eve use to be my favorite Yankee Candle scent. Last year I decided to try the Balsam and Cedar and I absolutely love it. It reminds me of the Christmases years ago when we had a live tree instead of artificial. I have a cat and dog and this scent helps to cover any odor they leave behind. I purchased 4 because of the great discount offered. Thanks for that Amazon.

  I was absolutely delighted when I received this candle. The scent was heavenly, and the size Is perfect. Big, but not too big! However, much to my surprise, and for the very first time in buying this brand of candle for 30 years, this candle had two defects. Not even halfway down the candle wick ran out, and the wax was actually bubbly. Just filled with little tiny bubbles throughout the entire candle. I must say again, I was truly surprised. But one product in 30 years isn’t bad. Normally, it’s an exemplary Product. This is why I will pay the price.

  This candle has a strong smell, but it's not overpowering. I burn this scent at Christmas time since I'm not a huge fan of sweeter scents like vanilla or Christmas cookie. This things burns clean and seems to last forever - I burned this for a few hours most days of the week during the holidays, and it's barely half used. It's also such a clean scent that you could easily use this outside of the holiday season. Unlike some customers, mine came packaged very well, and I didn't have any issues with breakage.

  The jar arrived in corrugated cardboard and was adequately packaged to keep the glass in tact. However, at some point the candle wax melted and arrived with the contents sideways in the jar.

  This forest scent was piney and natural, and I have no complaints about the candle itself, but during shipment in June, some of the evergreen fragrance oils leaked out of the jar and then ate completely through the styrofoam packing material cushioning the cap of the jar. The substance wasn't melted wax, but was actual green coloring plus oil that leached OUT of the wax. This is indicative to me either that there was a problem with product quality control or that Amazon should not have been shipping it to my location (Texas) in June, I purchased another scent (Cranberry Twist) that shipped in the same box, and it was fine with no leakage. Because this leakage changed the contents, I felt it compromised the safety of the candle, and I don't feel safe burning it.

  I ordered this candle from amazon and expected the same high quality and awesome fragrance I have gotten every other holiday season when I purchased directly from Yankee Candle Co. retail stores.  This one ordered from Amazon have NO fragrance whatsoever when lit.  We are totally disappointed in the product and find it NOT of Yankee Candle quality.  Don't buy !!!!!

  I am very disappointed, I buy Yankee candles often. Though the delivery was very fast 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟,There s no scent coming from the candle. It’s been burning for 6 hours, a day, and unfortunately I, and my family don’t smell the scent. I will be contacting the vendor. I know this isn’t their fault, by no means. I would hope, by contacting them, they will send me a replacement. Other than this unfortunate situation, Yankee Candles, by far are the best scented candles.

  I love the Yankee candles.  The scent permeates a room and beyond with good circulation.  Many candles don't do that. With others you have to xbend close to the burning candle to get the scent. After an hour or so left burning the essence extends from my living room and down the hallway. We have a small ranch style home. Very pleasant 👍😊

  I really wanted to have a holiday scent in my home since we have an artificial Christmas tree. I was weary of getting such a big candle in case I didn't like the scent but the price was really good for this size. I am thrilled with this candle.

  Very light aroma subtle even, minty smells like something green.  I even forgot the candle was on. It was on for a while before I smelled something. I wanted something stronger and overpowering. For the price $11.50 for 22oz I couldn't resist and took the risk. My Glade candles are smaller and smell stronger and more widespread throughout the home more rapidly.,Bigger doesn't always mean better I realize. Seems like it gives off more of a fragrance after I blow the candle out? Interestingly odd-- lol Pleasant fragrance once the fragrance settles after blowing out the candle a waxy odor is present like something was burning (not a bad smell but a waxy odor)

  I bought this candle for the Christmas tree smell.  I'm not a fan of real trees but I absolutely love how real trees smell and these candles makes my home smell like I have a fresh cut Christmas tree.  The scent makes my home smell warm and cozy and puts my household in a more Christmassy feel.  The candle scent is light and not overpowering but strong yet subtle enough to be smelt though out the entire house.  One candle last for several hours and several uses.  The candle is a good price for the number of uses I will get.

  I like the smell a great deal. I've always been partial to cedar and they got the scent just right. However the wicks in the candle aren't quite long enough, which makes it a little tricky to light without burning my fingers on the match, and also causes the melting wax to cause the flame to sputter. It lasts about half an hour before the flame has nearly burned out.,On the other hand there's a great deal of wonderfully scented candle and I expect it to last a couple months, even burning a few hours a day. If balsam and cedar is your thing then this is probably worth the price tag.

  I love candles. Especially scents like Christmas Cookie. I bought this as a gift but of course inspected it for the person I was giving it to. First of all, it does smell great. It is a good candle but I feel like it doesn’t add up to the Yankee Candle quality. It’s almost like a walmart candle in a yankees package. The price was great which is why I bought it from Amazon, but it doesn’t seem to match the quality at all that yankee provides. However I also see that you get what you pay for, so for the price I still think it was worth it. Just beware thst the quality is not going to be like buying straight from the yankee candle store.

  My favorite candles from Yankee Candle are Pink Sands and Black Cherry, but when Christmas rolls around, it's always Red Apple Wreath for me. I just can't get enough. It's perfect: not too sweet, not too pine/tree, just the right spice and warmth for the season.

  Smells better than I expected. Reminiscent of Bath and Body Works Midsummer’s Night scent—more of a masculine smell than a Christmas tree smell. But my husband smells the Christmas tree so we are all happy.,Easily ‘giftable’.  Sturdy candle in a deep green color. Lasts long, burns evenly, no issues with the wick.

  I bought this awhile ago, and just used it recently to clear the air to my restroom. For some reason, I just could not enjoy the scent of this candle. I've used other scents from Yankee and always enjoyed them. Other than that, it's still a good candle, I would just stay away from this scent.

Sang Park,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Balsam & Cedar,Pattern Name: Candle",1.0 out of 5 stars,Weak Scent - Almost Non-Existent (No I don't/did not have COVID),"
  I didn't want to believe all the reviews about Yankee candle cheaping out quality and ingredients and still charging a high price for a vastly inferior product to what it was in the past, but I cannot deny the evidence in front of me. I chose this scent specifically because people claimed it was one of their stronger offerings. It seemed fine at the start, but once I got about 1/3rd into the jar, the scent pretty much went away completely unless I was standing directly on top of the candle while it was lit. It's pretty disappointing to see such a drop in overall quality. What good is having high burn time in a large jar when you pretty much smell nothing 80% of the time it's lit? Nothing more to say, there's enough other reviews out there that it can't be a coincidence.

  I was SO excited to find my favorite Holiday scent on Amazon so I ordered 4. I bought and received all 4, packaged. When removing them from the boxes I noticed that 3 of the 4 candles had been lit (see wicks). Some may appreciate the removal of any superstitious vibes from the candles by lighting the wick, :P but I was under the impression these were new. Worse than that, I had to use gloves to handle them because they were covered in the scented oil. Super disappointed.

  This is for the large jar candle that was under $12. The same size one is usually $26.00. I have had Yankee candle balsam and cedar candles before and this is nothing like them. Very disappointed.

  This is my first negative review. When I received the candle and opened the lid to the candle it smelled good, but after lighting it and letting it burn for a couple days 2-3 hours preferably each time. The candle has no smell to it at all and I mean at all!!! so I was confused and maybe thought it was my nose or something is wrong. so I asked several people that have come over to smell after I lit it and they said they do not smell it either so I would not waste my money on this sorry but definitely not worth the money!!,A $4 dollar candle at Walmart smells better than this

  I bought this candle to replicate the scent of cedar trees in Washington state, and it captures that for me. (Frankly, before I lived in WA state I thought the scent didn't represent any forests I'd been in, but it really does...). I don't light it, I just uncap and recap it periodically to keep the scent. We don't have this store in my area so it was nice to find it on Amazon. I've also found there's a similar scent in Scentsicles Tree Ornament White Winter Fir Scented Sticks.

  The scent is nice, but does not throw well.  My main issue with this candle is that it does not burn correctly.  I trimmed the wick before the first burn and every burn since then.  I follow all the tips Yankee Candle suggests, but this candle is burning straight down the center, which basically cuts the candle's life in half.  I just purchased another 'new' scent from Yankee Candle and that one is giving me the same problem.  I think I will stick to my trusted scents as I have never had this issue before.  The Cranberry Chutney candle I bought at the same time as this one is still burning nicely and the scent is wonderful.

Erik Bond,"Size: Large 2-Wick Tumbler,Style: Christmas Cookie,Pattern Name: Candle",2.0 out of 5 stars,Hard to believe that this is an authentic product,"
  I find it hard to believe that this is a Yankee Candle product after having purchased a few tumblers directly through YC in the past. I noticed immediately that the wax was bubbly, wicks were thin, scent was mild, and glass rim had a wide smeared ring around the inside so was skeptical. It’s cheap so I figured I’d live with it. But it’s terrible - the wax around the edges doesn’t melt and wicks keep getting extinguished by the melted wax. On the plus side, I discovered that Bath & Body Works has great stuff since I needed something to mask my Manhattan apartment neighbors’ holiday cooking.

  This isn’t the real thing.  It doesn’t emulate the amazing smell you are expecting if you are a fan of the Balsam and Cedar. We had this same scented candle (bought through the Yankee Candle site last year) in our house and compared this new one and our old one. Hardly a scent from this new one.  Looked at the stickers on the bottom.  Our old one was made in America.  This one was made in Czech Republic...so different.

  It is unfortunate that Yankee Candles do not work as well as they did in the past.

  I love the smell of these candles.  The balsam and cedar make the house smell like a fresh, clean morning in the forest.  They also last a long time too.  The one tool that I did purchase for my candles was a wick trimmer.  I thought it might be a frivolous purchase at first, but it only cost $10, so I decided to get it.  Wow - now I can't live without it.  If you trim your candles within 1/8"" each time before you use them, it will burn more evenly and prevent the black smoke that happens when a wick ""blooms"" and isn't trimmed.

  Classic Yankee Candle; nice glass jar, great scent, good looks. Arrived in a form-fitting cardboard surround, in a box. Nice buy. If you got this while it was 14.99 (like I did), you scored a bargain!

  I love the scent of the candle, that’s why I bought it. But when I opened the box, the rim of the glass holding the candle was broken.,I’m not going to be able to use the top cover.,The candle is still usable, but it would’ve been nice to be able to use everything I ordered.,I won’t be returning it because I don’t have the time. I think one more layer of packaging material is necessary.

  I used to love the wonderful natural tree scent. It used to be that Within 30-60 minutes the powerful fragrance would permeate my room, and I loved it. With the last 5 jars  purchased I returned 2. I'm now  burning the third and it is sad. After 3-4 hours burn there is no noticeable scent. I literally had to bring my nose to the rim of the jar to notice any scent.

  What a wonderful Christmassy scent! Makes up for my fake tree that looks awesome but is missing that pine smell.  Stuck this in a candle warmer in the same room and voila, we're all in Buffalo plaid, deep in a forest, holding mugs of hot chocolate with our mittened hands.  Yeah, it's THAT good.

  Like others I found this candle lacking in scentpower.  It’s a pleasant smell but lighter than I was hoping for and it seems to come and go.  It took several hours for the first real whiff.....subsequent burnings have been inconsistent as if the scent oils are not evenly dispersed throughout the wax.

  The first 3 times I burned this is smelled FANTASTIC! Great holiday scent. But after that, it did not have a noticeable pine scent for the remainder of the candle. I don’t know if I just got a bum one or if Yankee quality hasn’t decreased since the last time I got one (which has been years).  I still just like to have candles burning for the ambiance so I used it till it was gone,  but was disappointed by the lack of scent.

  The smell is amazing. However the burn life is terrible. I have had many Yankee Candles and they last a really long time. Unfortunately this candle did not even last 50 hours. Im still buying another one, because I really like the cookie smell, and the candle has an extremely low in price.

Linda L Egley,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Balsam & Cedar,Pattern Name: Candle",1.0 out of 5 stars,No scent,"
  I have been buying Yankee candles for years, but I feel that this one is defective!  It has very, very little scent. I usually can smell a candle as soon as I walk into the room, but I have left it lit for an hour at a time, and you can't even tell that it's burning. No aroma, whatsoever.,I would like a replacement, as I believe when this one was manufactured, it had a bad batch!

Janice,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Balsam & Cedar,Pattern Name: Candle",1.0 out of 5 stars,Very little scent,"
  I have used Yankee Candles for years.  I have not bought one for quite a while until recently.  I had read somewhere that the scents aren't as strong now as they were previously.  I thought ""that can't be"" but it is true.  When I burn it (Balsam & Cedar) & someone comes into the room they don't notice it & I don't either.  I am very disappointed.  I WILL NOT buy another Yankee Candle.

  This candle is like Christmas in a jar! The perfect scent to have burning all winter long. It's VERY strong and can easily fill up my 1,050 sqft townhome. My only criticism is that, it didn't seem to last the 110-150 burn hours it should have. I'd burn it for a few hours a day throughout the month of December, and it was down to almost nothing by mid January. Maybe that's normal, but I would have expected it to last longer.

Lance Cothern,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Balsam & Cedar,Pattern Name: Candle",1.0 out of 5 stars,Candles No Longer Fill Room With Smell,"
  We had this same exact scented candle from a few years ago. It finally ran out, so we replaced it with the same exact scent from Yankee Candle. Unfortunately, the new candle doesn't fill the room with a smell like the old candles did. You have to smell directly over the flame to get any whiff of the scent at all. Sad.

  Bought the candle back in June and had not had a chance to use it until now. Opened it up and no wick. Dug around looking for it but nothing. Too late to return and Yankee Candle would not work with me on the warranty because I bought it through a 3rd party. Check the candle for a wick when you receive and don't get burned by waiting too long. Smells great though.

I didn't know what it would smell like but now that I've burned through most of it I have to say it is without a doubt the most unique and incredible smelling candle ever, coming from someone who sniffs every one I pass in the store.

Malcolm Fulcher,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Balsam & Cedar,Pattern Name: Candle",1.0 out of 5 stars,"What faint scent existed was so horrible, I could not stand it","
  Problem was not with Amazon.  Problem was with the Yankee Candle itself.  There was NO scent of balsam and cedar.  What faint scent existed was so horrible, I could not stand it. Now just to be certain I was not having problems with my ""smeller"" I passed it around to some folks I had attending a social function I was hosting.  ""ALL"" turned away quuickly when they got a whiff, and suggested I ""blow out"" and ""throw out"" immediately.  It was awful.  So it was returned to Amazon who quickly refunded my money.  Yankee Candles, always expensive, are supposed to be the best........no soot, great,strong aroma that could smell up an entire room.  Not anymore.  This will be my last ""Yankee"" candle ever.  Please do not waste your money.  I did have an Ashland Candle (supposedly made by Yankee) that smelled wonderful.  Go figure. Have no idea what was wrong.......except perhaps it was very old.  Do not go there, my advice.

  For the outdoors kind of person who want to bring that smell inside this is the candle. Balsam & Cedar... freshens the air & eliminates oder. The sent last to the very bottom of the jar. Will be buying more for the winter months when we are all stuck in the house.

  Very fresh scent... distinct evergreen notes.  I like it a lot.  It is more subtle than some of their other candles...which can be good or bad depending on your needs.  It is not overpowering and has been well accepted by men and women alike in my home. Excellent yankee candle quality as always.

  Yankee candles in general are great in that they last forever, burn evenly, and are generally pretty. And for those reasons, they are worth the price. The ""Christmas Cookie"" scent is a wonderful change from regular Vanilla and is versatile to burn all year round. The scent is strong enough to be noticed but not overpowering. The only drawback to this candle is that it might induce cravings for cookies!!

Kokomo,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Balsam & Cedar,Pattern Name: Candle",5.0 out of 5 stars,Illuminations?,"
  It is my understanding that Yankee Candle acquired the Illuminations Candle company, which had been our favorite.  We do not find the Yankee Candles to be as long-lasting nor with the intensity of fragrance.  But, I guess it's the best we can do.  The candle arrived on time and undamaged.,I am not saying Yankee Candles are bad, just we preferred the Illumination Candles.

  So disappointed! This is one of my very favorite scents and I’ve been buying it for many years (over 10 at least) and it could easily fill my house with yumminess. The candle I received had a muted cold smell but NOTHING once lit. I’ve never had this happen with any Yankee Candle. I’ll not purchase them from Amazon again, only in their stores for easy returns. I’m sticking to 3 wicks from Bath and Body Works for a bit.

  Sometimes it's just worthwhile to spend a little more money.  Yankee candles are among the more expensive candles you can get but in my own opinion you get what you pay for.

karen roberts,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Balsam & Cedar,Pattern Name: Candle",1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad smeller,"
  This actually smells old and leaves a waxy smell and almost smells like a dirty cat box. I was planning on giving this to my mother for Christmas to go with her candle wax burner. :(Had to substitute it with one I already had. Very upset about it. They cost so much, they should live up to the price and if they are being sold old or as one that is no longer being made, they should let people know that they have been on a shelf for a while . therefore the consumer can make that decision whether to take a chance on an older candle.

tolkien lewis fan,,3.0 out of 5 stars,NOT like Bath & Body Works' Balsam scent,"
  I know it's going out on a limb to purchase a scented candle I've never smelled in person.  However, based on the positive reviews, I hoped this would be similar to Bath & Body Works' ""Fresh Balsam"" scent, which is the very best ""Christmas-tree-like"" scent I've ever tried.  Unfortunately, the B & Bdy Works candles in this scent only come in wide, shorter jars and my candle warmer needs a taller jar.,This candle is high-quality as far as being attractive in color and with good, strong fragrance.  It also fits my Hurricane Lamp candle warmer perfectly.  However, the fragrance itself is what I personally do not like.  It's a much more ""old-fashioned"" scent, reminding me of a candle my grandmother would have used back in the 70's or 80's.

  I always have several Yankee candles burning in my home at one time, they are all in different rooms, and this is a year around activitie for me. This particular candle, the Balsam Cedar is one of my all time favorite fall and winter favorites, that I really enjoy burning. You will not be disappointed with the throw from this candle, in my opinion it's one of the best in their line. It smells really nice, yet it is not,overpowering. I would say this is one of my favorite candle scents from Yankee. The fragrance of this candle has a fresh forest/Christmas tree scent that would be expected, but I also get notes of sandalwood, and berries too. Actually all of the Yankee candles are known for smelling great, and being great quality. But, if you’re going to splash out on buying one, you want to make sure you’re getting the best Yankee Candle scents possible. Yankee makes sure to select good quality ingredients for their candles, as well as using high quality wax and natural wicks. So you can be sure you’ll have a candle that won’t let you down. I highly recommend them, and they also make really great gifts. This is an honest and true review. I was not paid, nor did I recieve free product in exchange for my opinion or review. Shann💓

  No matter what I have spent on candles in my long life, Yankee candles are always the best candles anyone can buy anywhere. PERIOD!  Don't waste your money buying other brands..The scents are wonderful, they burn perfectly..(just be sure to trim the wicks) and they're well worth the money. I miss getting them by the case on holidays, but my husband no longer knows the owner of the company we shopped at in MA. I'd just be careful WHERE you buy them as some people, selling them, may have stale candles that lost their scent..Buy from Yankee candle itself..to get the best freshest candles.

Ellis Bell,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Christmas Cookie,Pattern Name: Candle",1.0 out of 5 stars,Avoid Yankee Candle like the plague,"
  Avoid Yankee Candle like the plague!  If you want scentless burning wax imbued with a lovely chemical smell this is the company for you!!  Yankee Candle, a former family-owned company sold their business a few years ago and the quality is now nonexistent.  I placed a huge order with YC as I've done for years because the candles and tarts always held their scent and I didn't worry about having to burn them before they ""went bad.""  So when my new order arrived which included Autumn, Holiday and everyday scents I was shocked to find every tart and jar had minimal scent and an overwhelming odor of wax and chemicals.  Some of the tarts were like a crumbled dust when unwrapped.  It's a darn shame what this new company has done to a well regarded brand but I suppose they'll buy a clue when they end up selling their overstock to low-end stores.

Aaron B.,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Balsam & Cedar,Pattern Name: Candle",1.0 out of 5 stars,Poorly Designed Formulas - Won't Liquefy to Glass,"
  I'm giving up on Yankee candles. I thought I got a bad one or two, but they're all like that. They just don't burn to the glass, and you're left with a wax funnel.  You get a new one, make sure the wick is 1/8"", give it a light, and wait for four hours. It's not liquefied to the glass. Give it another four hours, and it still won't. And *another* four hours, and you've got a wax funnel. I've tried stopping trimming every four hours, but that doesn't help. I always end up babying it and holding a charcoal lighter to the glass and/or hard wax, and then using a plastic soon to cultivate the candle. It takes an entire tank of butane and then some.  I threw my last one out and swore them off in favor of Sonoma or Woodwick.

  I have always loved Yankee candles and would always buy them when I could afford to. When I do buy them I buy quite a few and spend quite a bit of money. But here lately I am very disappointed in the quality of their candles. The candles do not have the secent that  they once had. You can see the difference when burning the candles. There is no where as much oil in them that there use to be and this is very obvious by the scent as well as the colors turn after burning the candles. I am not satisfied at all with the quality of Yankee candles product here lately. I did purchase a candle from my local grocery store recently which was a quater of the price of a yankee candle and it gave off a much more detectable scent for a longer period of time. It is definitely time for me to reconsider spending so much on a product whose quality has tremendously went down. I hope to find a candle that will make my house feel like home, and leave a nice, long lasting scent.

I smelled other candles at Walmart from Yankee and they were stronger so I think it might just be this scent.

  I love Yankee Candles for all the traditional reasons; they smell great and are long lasting. It wasn't until recently I discovered they have a hidden safety feature. MY boyfriend found himself throwing a tantrum and getting quite aggressive reverting back to a toddler state where you feel the need use your hands unnecessarily. I picked up my large clean cotton Yankee Candle and hurled it at his head. He went down then came back up dazed and retreated. It wasn't until I picked my Yankee Candle back up I realized it didn't even crack despite hitting a LARGE cranium and falling to the hard floor. I will now make sure to have a large Yankee Candle in every room because their fragrance mixed with the scent of ""You Tried It"" smells so much sweeter. Even the display gives, ""Remember what I am capable of"" vibes Highly Recommend.

  In all fairness, I must give an update.  Thought I'd take a chance and buy another Mistletoe candle today (October 24, 2013).  The scent seems to be a good deal stronger than the one I bought previously in 2008.,Nice and sweet scent similar to a Christmas tree - dare say it's one of the closest to a Christmas Tree that Yankee Candle has.  My wife likes the candle, so it must be good!,Upgrade to a four star - recommended.,Earlier review:,While other reveiwers have given this candle a 5-star rating, I have to give it a 3 mainly because the scent was too weak for me.  Personally, I like candles to pack some ""punch"" when they burn and Mistletoe, while a pleasant smelling candle, is not as strong as some of the other Yankee candle scents.,The candle smells good while in the store and does smell okay when burning, but the scent is just a little too weak for me.  The scent is definitely piney, but could have been stronger (in my humble opinion).,If you like a candle with a subtle piney scent, then this one's for you.  Otherwise, get another scent if you like something stronger.

  Yankee Candle Holiday Bayberry is a good candle for the person looking for a good Christmas time scent.  The description says the main scents are:  pine, fir, laurel, bayberry, frankincense, and myrrh.  The scents blend together smoothly and results in a nice piney scent.  Great Christmas time scent, especially with the frankincense and myrrh (According to the Bible, the wise men gave these and gold as gifts to the young Jesus Christ, hence the appeal to Christians).,Great strong scent that is probably best used during the fall and winter.,Highly recommended!

Jodie Meisenholder,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Balsam & Cedar,Pattern Name: Candle",5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally a good pine scent.,"
  Yankee candle never seems to fail. I have always had a hard time finding a pine scented candle that doesn't make your head feel ten times larger than it should be after smelling it for a few minutes. This candle reminds me so much of the cool, dew laden mornings when I would camp up in the sierras and I have always wanted that fresh forest air smell in my house. Yankee scents are potent so I would suggest using this candle in a larger room or an open room such as a living room or kitchen where it can waft around your house and not get trapped and overbearing. This scent would be a perfect addition to your home as you put up your holiday decor and get into the wonderful holiday spirit, and adds a fresh liveliness to a room that has a fake christmas tree in it. For anyone who has been looking for that perfect pine mountain scent, this is the one.

  Every year I buy Yankee Candles from the Yankee Candle store.  I also give them as gifts at Thanksgiving to start off the holiday season.  I have been willing to pay the high price for the candles because of their scent. I am very unhappy with my Christmas Cookie candles this year, might as well bought a cheap generic candle(would not because I don't like them), you can barely if at all smell the scent....I have a pretty good nose and no cold....will never buy Yankee Candles again.  This makes me sad because it was something I always looked forward to at Christmas. Sadly it seems that Yankee Candles has joined the Greed Makes the World go Round people.

Rebecca Katherine,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Mistletoe,Pattern Name: Candle",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Scent of Christmas!,"
  I'm a huge fan of Yankee Candle, especially their Housewarmer line.  I'm also a huge fan of the Christmas season, so what a combo!  The Mistletoe scent brings to mind a slightly semi-sweet yet refreshing Christmas greenery and pine boughs combination.  Very ""Christmasy"", not overpowering!,I make sure to stock up on these for Christmastime, and I give smaller jars as gifts to friends.,I have tried many other brands of candles meant to scent up whole rooms, and none come close to Yankee Candle in quality.  I have a very sensitive sense of smell, and most other brands are either too weak, or are so overpowering as to make one nauseous!,Yankee Candle gets it ""just right"" every time.  For Christmastime you can't beat the scent of Yankee Candle's Mistletoe!

It has a very woodsy smell to it, and not an entirely cold smell like Sparkling Pine. PS my candle is much more green than the picture here.

Blythe,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Christmas Wreath,Pattern Name: Candle",4.0 out of 5 stars,Best smelling candle in the Yankee Candles line,"
  This is the only candle I've ever found that really, genuinely smells like Christmas.  Fresh-cut spruce and pine, crisp and clean, smells completely natural.  Just opening the jar is like getting a smell of Christmas.  This is absolutely the best pine scented candle I've ever found and by far the best in the Yankee candle line.  There's a reason this scent always seems to sell out first in the shops!  The only reason I haven't given this 5 stars is that I do think it's a bit overpriced.  But there's really no other candle that can compare to this smell.

  For years Yankee candles were my vice. A little pricey, but worth the extra cost with their fresh, long-lasting scent. A few years ago, after the original company was bought out, something changed in their formula or their process. The candles still have a wonderful scent, but the ones I own, Balsam and Cedar and Green Grass, are so faint that the scent only throws a few feet from the candle, and that after burning for an hour or more. Burning for an entire day won't even scent the whole room. Such a disappointment.

  Over the years I've purchased many Yankee ""Christmas Wreath"" scented candles. When my tree went up I would enjoy the scent that was so much like a real Christmas tree. My son just got one for his girlfriend because he too remembers the fragrance of Christmas. When I smelled the candle he'd gotten from Amazon, there was no hint of the""Christmas Wreath"" I remember. Everything in the stores seem to be shrinking and the quality isn't the same. Is this another example. Very disappointed.

Daniel Johns Chair Fan,,1.0 out of 5 stars,Customer Service,"
  This review is not for the candle itself, which is amazing, although overpriced. It is for Yankee Candle's extremely poor customer service. They took over 3 weeks to ship my order, and when I called and sent emails, they were rude and unhelpful. They didn't answer my questions or adequately address my concerns. They said they would refund my shipping cost, but haven't as of yet, after numerous calls and emails. Several times I tried to call and couldn't even get through- got a busy signal or a recording saying the wait would be over 30 minutes!! So I actually had to call a different department and talk to someone who didn't know anything about their shipping/customer service policies. Ridiculous! I will never order from them again, which is a real shame, since I love their candles!

C. Saj,,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for the holiday season,"
  For some reason I was given this candle as a gift one christmas. I thought it was perhaps because my apartment smelled? Regardless, I am hooked now.,First off the glass jar is aesthetically pleasing with most any decor. The front label does not come off easily, but it's a Yankee Candle so most people like to leave it on. The lid is also glass with a rubber ring to seal the candle. It is easy to light and burns very evenly. I keep the wick trimmed usually. Occasionally I will put it on a candle warmer, and fits most that you can buy in stores/online.,The smell at first can be a little overwhelming, but this will occur with any candle. However, over time it provides a nice light hint of pine and cedar, which I find quite relaxing. The smell is not heavy, but quite refreshing and can brighten up a room, especially during the winter/holiday months. Highly recommend to men/women or anyone looking for a good quality and valued pine scented candle.

  In my humble opinion, Holiday Bayberry is one of the better Yankee Candle holiday scents.  The candle is supposed to contain a hint of pine, fir, laurel, frankincense, and myrrh.  The blend is great and the scents complement one another, with pine appearing to be the dominant scent.,If you are looking for a candle that is a bit different from the regular Christmas Tree scents, then this one's for you.  The scent is strong and unique.,Recommended.

  Once again I bought a few Yankee Candles from the Yankee Candle store and once again was disappointed. I purchased a Medium Cozy Cabin as it smelled great in the jar. At 33% burned the scent is gone and as usual the wick is not centered so one side of the wax isn't melting. This may seem trivial but for what I paid for these candles I am disappointed. I bought several candles much less expensive at another store that are no worse but has a centred wick. My expectations for the Yankee brand were set higher but are melting away.

P. Schneider,,5.0 out of 5 stars,Christmas Wreath candle,"
  When you first open this candle, you get a distinct smell of fresh cut pine boughs. When I first experienced this candle, I was looking all over for the pine tree or pine decorations. It really smells like a fresh Christmas wreath and it's worth every penny. Now I don't have to buy evergreen boughs for my home just to get the Christmas tree smell.

Stella L.,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Mistletoe,Pattern Name: Candle",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very festive!,"
  We just purchased this candle at Bed Bath and Beyond with a coupon not truly knowing what to expect. This candle filled the house with a festive scent that gave you a wonderful holiday feel. We didn't get a tree this year, but it sure smells like we did! We plan on stocking up on this scent and planning on trying other scents by this company since this was our first Yankee Candle purchase. I would definitely give this candle as a gift. :)

Marissa,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Christmas Cookie,Pattern Name: Candle",1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy!!!,"
  I just bought FOUR holiday scented Yankee candles and can't smell a damn thing from any of them unless I put my nose so close to the flame that I would burn it off.  Yankee Candles is ripping people off with their falsely advertised ""scented"" candles, and as a candle connoisseur, I'm offended by it.  If you are going to pay for overpriced candles, at least buy the Bath & Body works ones, which actually emit a fragrance through your home!

Michael Taylor,,4.0 out of 5 stars,Red Apple Wreath,"
  The Red Apple Wreath scents are supposed to be composed of cinnamon, red apples, maple, and walnut.  The cinnamon and red apples appear to be the strongest.  In my humble opinion, while the candle can be used year-round, the scent is most appropriate for the fall and winter.  A pretty good scent from Yankee Candle.  If you like red apples and cinnamon, then this candle is for you.,Recommended.

Several times I tried to call and couldn't even get through- got a busy signal or a recording saying the wait would be over 30 minutes!!

LaRue Avery,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Christmas Cookie,Pattern Name: Candle",1.0 out of 5 stars,I use to be the biggest fan and the scent was wonderful and filled the room,"
  Yankee Candle has changed so much since I first purchased.  I use to be the biggest fan and the scent was wonderful and filled the room.  Now you have to be within 3 feet to even get a whiff.  I quit buying a couple of years ago and buy the tea lights (which use to be wonderful in a bedroom) once a year to see if they have improved.  So sad.

  Home for the Holidays was one of my favorite Yankee candle holiday scents. It’s a strong aroma that filled the whole house. I know it’s retired so I was thrilled to see I could get it on Amazon.  As soon as I sniffed the open jar I knew something wasn’t right and I had an old candle to compare it to. My mistake was lighting the candle because now it can’t be returned.  It’s been burning for 3 hours. What scent do I smell?  NONE. I even put it in a room and closed the door. Came back an hour later. No scent. What a waste of almost $30. Very disappointed.

Kathryn Magendie,"Size: Large 2-Wick Tumbler,Style: Balsam & Cedar,Pattern Name: Candle",3.0 out of 5 stars,Glade scents actually better than this Yankee for less $,"
  I suppose I have been spoiled by other balsam and cedar candles so I was a little disappointed in the scent of this Yankee Candle candle. I’ve always heard they are supposed to be excellent candles but I wasn’t wowed by it. It was nice enough. The scent was okay. But I wasn’t super happy with it either. So that’s why the middle of the road 3 stars—not wowed; it was okay; nice enough scent but wish it had been a bit stronger; wish the candle had lasted longer.,I’m still looking for scents like the candles I bought from restoration hardware stores—their balsam/cedar candles were absolutely wonderful and I can’t find those any more—pity, as they were my favorites. As well, Rugged & Dapper balsam candle is one of the best scents and the glass is beautiful—I bought one of those for my guy and he loved it; I wanted one for myself but they sold out quick at Christmastime!,This Yankee Candle balsam candle didn’t last long. The scent is nice but not quite strong enough. And the glass jars/pillars they come in aren’t ones I really care to leave out to display—though this pillar was a nicer than the design  I bought for a friend.,For the scent comparison with Yankee, I’d rather pay far less and buy Glade, as those scents are just as good as this Yankee Candle Balsam candle for a fraction of the cost. Or, spend a bit more and buy the ones I really enjoy.,Thank you for reading my review.

"BOB FROM MOUNTAIN HOME, AR","Size: Large Jar,Style: Balsam & Cedar,Pattern Name: Candle",1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  NO SCENT AT ALL,"
  For a Yankee Candle, and the price I paid, I was very disappointed. The smell was non-existent. I thought Yankee were once the best? Apparently greed must have killed them like it does so many businesses these days. You get people running the biz that want to start using cheaper quality materials to make more profit, and they raise prices to ridiculous levels because people love their products. Only they don’t realize people aren’t as stupid as they hoped. The people begin to realize that they just aren’t as good as they once were and they are WAY out of the ballpark now for the Quality to Cost ratio. So people try another brand and go wow, that’s a great candle! And they never go back. They then talk to their friends about it and the friends “wake up” and go “your right, their candles just aren’t that great anymore. Their prices have gotten ridiculous anyway.” It is now that they switch too over to that other brand that really knows how to make a great smelling candle, that stays smelling great, until the last bit of life leaves the flame on the wicks.,I know for a fact that this happens as stated above. It is from direct experiences on my part, multiple times as well. I even started polling our friends and the majority of them actually verified the same sentiment. That Yankee Candles, which used to be everyone’s favorite, have gone downhill so badly and have gotten so crazy expensive, that it just does not make sense to keep wasting the amount of time I have to work to pay for them. I work hard. I want quality for my money and time. I’m not going to spend an hour working to throw away on garbage. Companies don’t respect the people who work to pay their salaries. The only thing they care about is my money and not the time I slaved at work just to purchase their crappy product. What happened to the days when “customers come FIRST”? They’re gone and now it’s only about taking your money/time and passing it on to the fat executive that’s destroying their brand, just to make themselves and their greedy shareholders fatter and richer off the backs of those who do the REAL work in this world.... just for the privilege of buying their overpriced trinkets.

Kathryn Magendie,"Size: Medium Jar,Style: Balsam & Cedar,Pattern Name: Candle",4.0 out of 5 stars,Not as quality as Rugged & Dapper! But the scent is foresty and the price is right,"
  Update: this candle is twice the size of the Rugged & Dapper, so it's the better buy, really. And my guy says it smells great so I purchased the pillar candle in the balsam & cedar scent and it was on sale for less than $17—I like the pillar better than the old-fashioned jar his came in. The scent is strong but not overwhelmingly strong: I like it. It’s not the best balsam & cedar candle I’ve ever had but it smells good and provides a nice forest scent to the room.,-----,I bought my guy this Yankee Candle balsam and cedar candle because the one I really wanted was sold out. Rugged & Dapper makes the best forest-scented candle I’ve ever smelled and he loved it and used the entire candle—and the Rugged & Dapper glass jar the candle is in is attractive. This was an in-a-hurry impulse buy when R&D was sold out, though I don’t like the presentation of this Yankee Candle with the old-fashioned jar look; however, balsam & cedar candles are difficult to find.,I don’t like this jar—I wish Yankee Candle did something better with their balsam & cedar scent instead of this old-fashioned jar look. It looks cheap and like something I’d buy at Big Lots. That’s my one disappointment.(Update: I purchased the pillar candle for myself and it is more to my liking than the jar.),As far as the scent, it smells really good! Not quite as good as the Rugged & Dapper candle in the same scent, but the scent is strong enough to permeate the room and give that Christmas-at-time-of-the-year scent. Though Rugged & Dapper edges out Yankee Candle in scent, too.,For the money, this is a lot of candle—both the jar and the pillar I later bought—and will last a long time, and it smells good.

  Purchase (2) of the Balsam and  cedar candles and they arrived today. They were expensive,  but I counted on the Yankee Candle name to deliver as it always has in the past. The scent can only be smelled if I stand directly In  front of it. I was so excited happily waiting for them to arrive. I can only say this purchase will never be made again. I purchase Yankee candles  all the time and never had this problem: they must be old.,One star was given for the scent I ordered , which, I love;  however this scent is mere wax burning -  nothing more.

Anna,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Christmas Cookie,Pattern Name: Candle",1.0 out of 5 stars,What has happened to Yankee Candle?,"
  I used to purchase only Yankee Candles as they were the best ones ever. After a move, the only local option became Bath and Bodyworks so I tried those and they were wonderful too. This week, I decided to order a couple of homey type Yankee Candles that I had loved in years past: French Vanilla and a Cookie flavored one. They arrived today and neither of them have hardly any scent when you sniff them cold. I figured once lit things would get better. Nope. I have one of each of the ones I bought burning in a different part of the house and you'd never know there was a scented candle lit.,Seems every company that puts out a product that is wonderful, decides at some point to go cheap and ruin it. I won't buy this brand again. BBW candles are amazing and have wonderful throws.

Cynthia J Sanders,"Size: Large 2-Wick Tumbler,Style: Mistletoe,Pattern Name: Candle",1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed...these Mistletoe candles from Amazon were not up to usual YC quality.,"
  Very disappointed.  This double wick tumbler in the Mistletoe scent is literally the only scented candles I purchase. I KNOW how they should perform. With these the scent was minimal to non-existent and the flame was dull.  So I just bought some directly from Yankee Candle. They arrived today. The house is filled with the fragrance, and they’re burning bright and clear...the way they should. Don’t know if the candles they sent from Amazon were stale or what, but I won’t buy any more thru Amazon, and I can’t recommend them to anyone else because they performed so poorly. Sorry. I don’t like writing negative reviews, but these buggers are expensive, and I’d hate to see others waste $$$ on them as I did.

N&G,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Mistletoe,Pattern Name: Candle",5.0 out of 5 stars,SO happy with this candle! Real Yankee Candle. Mistletoe scent.,"
  I have had a Yankee Candle Mistletoe candle for nearly 7 years now. I have only lit it here and there during the month of December. I finally ran out of the candle and ordered a new one here on Amazon. At first I chickened out after reading some poor reviews of people having suspicions it's not real or that they're ""old"" with no scent (I don't think age stops these candles from having a scent... I have several very old Yankee Candle candles that smell the same in all this time) and I cancelled my order. But then I decided to just go for it, ordered it again and it arrived today. It smells EXACTLY THE SAME as my Mistletoe Yankee Candle that I've had for years. It's not even fully melted the top and the scent has begun filling the room. So happy, wish I bought it sooner.

  I grew up less than an hour from the giant Yankee Candle in Massachusetts and have always been around them burning.  Never have I been so letdown by a Yankee Candle.  I don’t know if it’s this scent or if the quality has dropped over the years, but it barely smells.  To smell it while burning you have to put your face so close you feel the heat from the flame.  I would not recommend.

  Way back when, Yankee released a Balsam scented candle which I loved.  Then they changed it to this combo of balsam and cedar.  The scent is okay, but it took me awhile to figure out why I was coughing a lot when this was burning.  Then it hit me:  they use cedar and balsam oils to get the scent ... and I'm quite allergic to cedar!  Had to quit using Old Spice deodorant because of allergies to the cedar oils (for the scent).  I quit burning this candle and the coughing cleared up in a few days.,I'm now burning Christmas Cookie scent and no problems.  Just be advised.

Bob,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Christmas Wreath,Pattern Name: Candle",1.0 out of 5 stars,Lacking scent,"
  I have enjoyed Yankee Candles for many years. When I have burned them, I have enjoyed how they fill the space with a wonderful scent. In the past, if I burn the candle for a few hours, and then blow it out and leave the house, when I return, the scent still is lingering in the air. BUT NOT SO WITH THESE!!! Recently I ordered two of my favorite scent. When they arrived, the scent was barely detected. So - I thought this must be a produce defect. Because I love them so much, I returned them. (I rarely if ever return products.) I received two replacements very quickly. Thank you for the good service! HOWEVER, these candles have the same issue. I can burn them for hours and still not even smell the scent. Even when burning, if I hold the candle close, I only detect the very, very slightest scent. It is almost entirely undetectable. So now I again have two of my favorite, hard to find scents (Christmas Wreath), but do not have the pleasure of enjoying the scent of the candle. This is VERY disappointing! I wonder if Yankee Candle sells inferior products on Amazon? Would it be the same if I were shopping in their store?? This huge difference, after many years of enjoying the consistent quality in Yankee Candles, has been very disappointing.

  I absolutely LOVE this candle scent! I don't normally spend more than a few dollars on candles but I can totally justify this Yankee Candle purchase because the smell is so comforting and actually smells like sugar cookies baking. Perfect for relaxing while studying. The scent is worth the cost. I also noticed that the candle lasts a really long time compared to my bath and body works candles. The scent is strong enough to make my boyfriend believe I was baking cookies (lol), needless to say its a must! It's so hot in Texas year 'round practically but this candle makes it feel like Christmas!,This came in a yankee candle branded box and was packaged with styrofoam and arrived on time.

  This has the label of the “less expensive” Yankee Candle line that they make to sell through other stores, not the “classic” label on their in-store candles, so I didn’t expect it to be quite as nice as the ones you would buy directly from them. That being said, it’s a big candle for $15 that smells like a fir tree, which is exactly what I was expecting. I can smell it down the hall and it is lasting a while. My only complaint is that it gives off quite a big flame even after I trimmed the wick. I’ve paid a lot more for some other candles that were very disappointing, so I’m happy with this one.

  I have tried numerous candles searching for that  ""Christmas Tree""  scent, and have always been disappointed.  I found these "" Mistletoe"" candles on Amazon for a fantastic price and ordered 2.  I don't really do Christmas , but I do put up a little artificial tree but missed the tree scent. NO MORE!!!  Where I have the candles sitting is close to the HVAC units intake , and WOW,  when my heater kicks on it pulls the scent up through the system and makes my whole house smell like Christmas.  I WILL be buying more of these.  I think when people say a candle has NO throw they should place the candles close to the air intake of their HVAC unit. Remember heat rises and takes scent with it.

Purpledog,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Balsam & Cedar,Pattern Name: Candle",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not the YC I know and love...,"
  My absolute favorite scent from Yankee Candle but...living in MA, I can drive to YC and select my own (or make my own). Having found 'my' scent on Amazon at a discounted price by almost $8/jar candle, I bought 2 for the holidays. Extremely disappointed: hardly any scent unless I stick my nose into the unlit candle, the wicks are not centered on either one so they burn crooked and the wax pools so badly because of the crooked wick that even with rotating the candle countless times during the burning hours, it extinguishes the wick time and time again and still forms that carbon ball at the top of the wick. That causes a very high flame when next ignited so trimming is necessary. Just a huge disappointment. I'll burn them because returning them would cost more than the candles cost me initially, but never again. I'll stick to paying a little more for a much higher quality candle from Yankee Candle direct.

  Who doesn't love Yankee Candles? No one I know. I would be hard pressed to name my #2 favorite fragrance, for there are several, depending on the season. But Sparkling Snow is my all-time, all-year favorite. When I was teaching, my classroom was three-quarters of the way down a long hall.  I would arrive early every morning, and part of my routine was to light my S'Snow candle. By the time the students and other faculty members arrived, the hall smelled like new-fallen snow in a piney woods. Many commented on how much they liked it, even the students. It's a fresh, clean fragrance--not overwhelming like some strong pine cleaner at all. I also appreciated that it lasted a very long time, and would last even longer on a candle warmer. I was sad when the scent was discontinued for a few years and rejoiced to see it available again.

They come in a large jar candle that will burn for many hours. The tight fitting lid, will snuff out your candle when you put it on.

  I will never purchase another Yankee candle because of the black soot issue they've apparently had for years. Their candles are made of parafin wax and it's alarming to see all of the black soot on every surface after just a few days of burning.  I keep trimming the wicks and the soot continues to turn everything dingy. I threw the candles away today and caution everyone looking for scented candles to avoid Yankee and purchase soy candles instead.

  eta: Sorry for the length of this!!,I love Yankee Candles, and when I saw them for this price, I ordered two of my favorite scents. Got them, (not in two days, however), and they were safely and well packaged inside a sort of thick cardboard eggcrate packaging.  It kept it from breaking. (I had received one last year which was only wrapped in bubble wrap, and it was broken and unusable.)I, Opened these, which were  ""Christmas Cookie"" and ""Home for the Holidays"". They smelled good in the jars and I lit them, one at a time in different rooms.,Total disappointment. They don't burn the faintest scent, even when you stand with your nose to them. Right after the flame got longer,  I snuffed them out and trimmed the wicks and relit them, as I have been taught to do. You can smell wax burning--that's it. Also, the lip of the jar is so thin and fragile, you must be very careful trying to fit the top back on. They didn't use to be quite this thin.,The one I got as a gift last year was from here, and it was broken in several places at the lip.  I thought, and still do, that it was because it was bubblewrapped carelessly., I used to pay $25 at least for these large candles, and I had to save up to get them! (Still do!),Here I saw these large Yankee Candles, and was thrilled at the price, thinking the prices had finally gone down, for  when I ordered, they were just below $14.00 each.,The lable looks the same, so I can't figure if these were somehow cheap knockoffs or what. The scents when you open the top are good--but there's no emittion of that scent while burning. Have Yankee candles diluted their formerly wonderful product? Hopefully not!,  Last night, I lit a candle from a large big-box store we all have heard of. It was an off brand that I picked up for eight bucks, and soon it was wafting all over the house. Unfortunately, it smelled like grape soda!,There is something very off when Yankee Candles don't do ""their thing"". We live on a fixed income and I rarely buy items of ""luxury"" like this, but these were sort of  my Christmas gift to me!, I know in the broad scope of things, this is a rather small thing, but Yankee Candles have never, ever disappointed me!!, If you can find a local dealer or can order directly from Yankee Candle's own storer, hopefully they will send you the great product for which they are known. I now have two candles which just will be handy if the power goes out. 😨

  You can't beat a Yankee candle. I'm a full grown 60 year old man that knows when times are stressful, a great way to help destress is by taking care of myself in my home. My best friend and fishing buddy was diagnosed with terminal cancer. I live in a beautiful area of the forest in northern California. He and his wife would come up often in his final years. I would light candles in their guest room before they arrived and they always commented on how nice it was to walk into the room with that smell. Having a nice scented candle when trying to let go of the weight is a great way to let go. Treat yourself or a friend to a little relaxer now and then.

However, for a change of pace I decided to try the 'Magical Frosted Forest' scent ~ and what a huge mistake!  It emitted absolutely no aroma.  I don't know if there was a problem in the manufacturing process ~ if someone simply forget to add fragrance to the batch, but it was as if I was only burning scent-free paraffin wax.  Knowing that this was just an anomaly as I've never experienced a problem with any Yankee Product before, I'd just recommend against purchasing THIS specific candle.

  Update: I let it burn about 10 minutes more and I’m finally getting some balsam scent!! I take back my 1 star and now give it 5. I literally bought this because we couldn’t have a real tree this year. So this is making me feel comforted. Thank you.,Pretty bummed. Opened it up and sniffed and got excited. Lit it ... and there’s no smell. Not what I expect from yankee candle. I guess I should’ve trusted the other reviews that mention the same issue. Not impressed y’all.

  I bought this candle for Christmas before my guests arrive and I was HIGHLY disappointed with the scent of this candle. It smells like one of those cheap candles you get from Walmart or The Dollar Store. I'm very very disappointed because I've bought many Yankee Candles in the past and I've NEVER been disappointed. This was a waste of money. I don't recommend the ""Christmas Eve"" scent AT ALL!

  This candle looks good.  When you open the lid it has a great christmasy smell so this engenders lots of hope that you will soon be sending the wonderful smell of the season through out your house.  But no... when you light the candle there is absolutely no smell what so ever.  Even if you sniff right over the candle... nothing.  Very disappointed.  Should have listened to the other reviews.

  I love when these candles are on sale. I try to buy the large YC's for $15 or less. They arrived in good condition and I was a fan of how long they last. Make sure to get a stick lighter to reach in there as the wax runs out. They look nice and are a product I'll buy again. I think though I have a cold the scent is coming off weak. It's too bad glade candles smell too much so I like to stick to these. I like how they come off in the evening, Im suddenly into candle light at night...

  Unfortunately, I used up my last Yankee Candle (Balsam and Cedar), and ordered a replacement for $21.62, plus tax.  I loved the original, but received this and burned it for several HOURS and almost NO SCENT.  Why is this?  Yankee has apparently changed their product, but are still selling it for the same (expensive) price.  No deal.  I won't be buying another Yankee Candle, unless they change back to their original formula and I happen to hear about it.

  I have been burning Yankee candles for years.  There is something wrong with this Red Apple Wreath candle.  From day one, it sputtered and sizzled when I tried to light the wick; like there is water in the candle.  I persisted, because I do like the smell, but it hasn't gotten better.  Oftentimes the candle puts itself out. leaving an unpleasant smoke pervading the air.  When I trim the wick, necessary to prevent black smoke when it gets too long, it starts up with the sputtering again when I try to light it.  I've tried putting the candle under a warmer to melt the wax, to pour out some of the wax, to elongate the wick.  This has been a fruitless process.  I've ended up pouring half of the candle out, trying to get it to burn properly.  At this point, the wick is too long.  Black smoke pours off of it when lit.  I'm afraid to trim it anymore, in fear that I'll have to pour out even more of what little is left of the wax.  I am very disappointed in this candle.  I wonder if it is truly a Yankee candle.

  Red Apple is probably my favorite of all the scents.,This candle doesn’t let me down with the true Red Apple scent either!,It fills my kitchen with that fresh apple scent after cooking something delicious, but smelly.,I wouldn’t feel comfortable giving this as a gift, because there were lots of tiny irregular bubbles on one side of the jar.

  This is the PERFECT candle for the holiday season. The balsm scent is very strong and makes the entire room smell like a Christmas tree. This is a large candle so it lasts a long time and burns pretty evenly. I buy several of them every winter.

Ashley M.,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Balsam & Cedar,Pattern Name: Candle",2.0 out of 5 stars,Weak Scent,"
  I usually love Yankee candles, but for some reason the candles that I recently ordered (Balsam Fir and Pumpkin) have very weak scents. I can’t even smell them when sitting right next to them and am very disappointed. I tested the one I had from a prior year and I could smell a single candle burning all throughout my home.

  First time Yankee Candle buyer here. I was skeptical of buying a candle online at first, but was tempted to try out this one because of the holidays and good reviews. I just want to say that this scent is the best scent I've ever smelled. It smells like a real Christmas tree, and has other hints of sweet scent to it as well. I love the glass it came in too, makes my house look very elegant. :) I light it in the kitchen and can smell it all throughout the house, it's quite strong.,Anyone who's having doubts about this candle.... Look no further! You'll love this scent. :) Will definitely be buying this again soon.

  Yankee Candles are the best if you like the scent you buy.  This candle is a mild scent and not over whelming.  Yankee always puts enough scent in their candles so you get the scent when it burns down at the bottom.  Most scents give me headaches , but this one did not.

  So happy to find Yankee Candles on Amazon at an affordable price as they are such good, long burning candles. They don't smoke up the house like that Candle-Lite brand, you can see, and smell a billow of black smoke from that brand., not from Yankee Candles. Long burning with moderate fragrance, not overpowering, just enough for burning a candle for hours, although the Balsam & Cedar is one of the more fragrant ones I've tried from Yankee.

  I am giving this one star because it does smell like a Christmas  Tree. The problem with this candle is it has a very weak scent. Even after burning for several hours it does not smell. For what they charge for this you would think it would be as good as other top name candles. The only way I can smell this candle is to walk up to it and stick my nose right up to it. This could be because they only have one wick or because Yankee Candle Company is  cutting corners to make a profit and they are not putting enough of the scent in the candles.

William D. Pearson,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Balsam & Cedar,Pattern Name: Candle",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not much scent,"
  I consider this candle a middle grade one based on the price.  However, the scent is very faint unless it is burned for an extended (1+ hrs) period of time.  Low end Walmart candles are better all around at less than half the price.

NEB,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Holiday Bayberry,Pattern Name: Candle",3.0 out of 5 stars,This season’s batches are coming through with indentations throughout the candles,"
  I have bought this candle numerous times throughout the years. It is usually as a Christmas gift. However this year the first one came in with indentations around the entire candle and a big circular indentation in the side. I re-ordered from a new batch, and I have vertical indentations, again, in two spots around the candle. Has anyone else experienced this? They are not cheap candles, but it seems the quality control has gone down.

  Literally smells like a fresh Christmas tree!  I get a real tree every year and it's exactly the same.  Only giving this 4 stars because the scent is surprisingly not that strong.  I have the candle in a ""mini living room"" upstairs in my house, and even with the ceiling fan on low blowing it around, it takes a little to circulate.  If anything, the scent is probably toned down a bit because pine can be really strong.  Would buy again!

  Yankee candles are our favorite. They last the longest of any other candle, and in our tiny apartment -- they fill it up with a great aroma without being overpowering. We love this because with our fake tree it makes it feel like we have a real one! Worth the investment for a holiday scent without it being too much.

  This candle is great for spreading that real Christmas tree scent around your house.  I buy these candles because the Yankee Candle Company seems to be the only company that really replicated the real smell of a pine tree, and it's great where you're using an artificial tree.  Other pine tree scents smell like Pinesol or have an element of perfume, but this scent (in the candle form or other forms that Yankee Candle produces) very closely replicates the actual scent of a pine tree.

  This is our family favorite candle for the holidays.  We burn at least one per week so our house smells like a Christmas Tree for the season.  I love that the candle burns evenly and almost completely without leaving a ton of wax unused.

  Ordered for Christmas time to add Christmas tree smell to our home since we have an artificial tree, and this was perfect. I liked this candle so much that I lit it daily until it wore out, and I plan to buy another for Christmas next year. I also liked that the label wasn't quite as ""Christmas-y""  looking as some so it wouldn't seem weird to use it into January.

HeatherY,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Christmas Cookie,Pattern Name: Candle",5.0 out of 5 stars,Rich Buttery Goodness,"
  I purchase this particular scent a lot, it's my mom's very favorite.  When I walk into my parent's house, I don't smell their dogs, last night's dinner, or even the coffee they have brewing.  I'm smacked in the face with a wall of this strong sugar cookie scent and it is wonderful.  The candles seem to last forever (or a few months until I buy her a new one).  They have a single wick which I personally prefer, as it increases the burn time, and the scent is really strong even with a single wick.,I do agree that the rim of the candle can become coated in soot, and the candle is so large it's difficult to reach all the way in to light it without getting soot on your hand.  A BBQ lighter or long match solves both those problems.

CTaylor,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Christmas Cookie,Pattern Name: Candle",1.0 out of 5 stars,Appears to be a fake. Smells like a dollar store candle,"
  I have been buying Yankee candles for 20 years. Ordered 2 Yankee candles and both came today. This particular one ""Christmas Cookie"" appears to be a fake! I'm 99% positive. The bottom of the jar doesn't have the ""normal"" Yankee candle sticker. Also it smells like a cheap vanilla sent from the dollar store. There is very little smell. You can also tell that it was poured very smoothly. Yankee candles are not smooth like that and have waxy oily fragrant bubbles in them! I have never been so disappointed. Definitely will never order from this seller again. I paid way to much money for this candle, for it to smell so cheap! I know what Christmas cookies Yankee candles smell like and this isn't it!!! I'm a stay at home mom so I don't get out often but lesson learned. So so disappointed! :(

Andrew Byrne,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Balsam & Cedar,Pattern Name: Candle",5.0 out of 5 stars,Essential for changing the atmosphere of the room you're in.,"
  No matter where I am, I've found that having a candle in the room really changes the environment. If you want the scent of the holidays in the air, this balsam and cedar candle is absolutely perfect for that. I like to light it and have it burning while I do computer work, and it helps with focus and serenity and all that. The jar is sizable and will burn for hours. The lid has a plastic stopper which helps to keep it sealed- and if you live in an apartment with hyper-vigilant smoke detectors, the stopper helps because you can extinguish the candle by putting the lid on it, and no smoke is released to the air. One of the complaints I used to have about Yankee Candles was that the middle of the wick area would burn downward, but the remainder of the candle would stay up at the top. The way to prevent this is to burn the candle long enough that it melts all of the top level surface of wax, so it distributes evenly when you are finished. Yankee candles are classy and interesting, and while I've had other candle brands, I keep coming back to Yankee for its aromas and high quality (i.e. evenly melting wax).

  This is definitely one of my top favorite candles of all time. Yankee Candles are always so darn expensive, but honestly it's worth it to me. The quality of these candles far exceed any other candle. You get what you pay for and it's great. The Christmas Cookie scent smells like sugar cookies or snickerdoodles. The scent lingers for awhile and the candle lasts a long time too. I love this candle!

xtina,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Balsam & Cedar,Pattern Name: Candle",2.0 out of 5 stars,scent is too sweet for my taste,"
  I am sure this is a very high quality candle in terms of staying power, but it's just too sweet smelling for me. I wanted a nice, mild, piney scent for the holiday season. This candle is definitely piney, but the aroma is too potent for me. I can only leave it on for about 30 minutes and then I start to feel kind of nauseated from the sweet fumes. I definitely think this has a sweeter scent than other pine-scented candles I've had, so if you're into that, then this may work for you. If sugary sweet aromas make you feel ill, then beware. In retrospect, it's clearly a mistake to order a scented candle online, as I think I would have been able to tell right away in person that this wouldn't work for me. Works fine for lots of people though--just depends on what you like! I've burned it a few nights now and it's barely burned down at all, so I'd say it's very well made, as one would expect of a Yankee candle.

  I like the fresh, outdoorsy scent of this candle.  I just wish it was stronger.  Usually I find that Yankee candles are pretty potent, so maybe the candle I got was from a weakly scented batch of wax, or maybe it's just this scent.  I still enjoy it, it just is kind of hard to notice unless you have just walked into the room or are right next to the candle.

Christine S.,"Size: Large Jar,Style: North Pole,Pattern Name: Candle",5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is by far, my very, very favorite Yankee Candle","
  I only buy Yankee Candles... yes they are more expensive, but you get what you pay for. They last longer and smell wonderful. A friend of mine had a candle burning at her house one Christmas. When we walked into her hallway it smelled like a candy cane... I asked her what that wonderful smell was and she showed me the North Pole Yankee Candle.. I was hooked from that moment. I can't tell you how many of these candles I have purchased from Amazon.com and have given to family and friends as gifts. Amazons prices are a little less than what I would get in a regular store and anyway, I can't find North Pole in any store in my area anymore. Some candles are sickingly sweet or very strong.. this one is perfect and doesn't assult the senses.,You will love, love it...,Christine C. Schubert

  With that candle, I have the same problem as with the Balsam. The sent is perfect and very realistic but the wick does not hold long. After a few hours, the wick would drown in the liquid part of the candle. And there is only one wick instead of two like before in that type of big candles so it's not helping either.

  This is a much faster way of getting Yankee candles than from the Yankee candle website.  I burn this candle in the kitchen so it smells like cookies baking.  MMmmmm.  These tumbler type containers (it is not the ""jar"") with two wicks burns a lot more evenly that the jar.

DWD,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Christmas Wreath,Pattern Name: Candle",3.0 out of 5 stars,My candle has very little smell.,"
  These just don't put out much smell at all. I have seen quite a few complaints about various Yankee Holiday candles in the jar being very weak. What it does put out is really nice. With Yankee Candle you apparently need at least a 2 wick version. This limits the life a the candle. As such I won't be buying any more single wick candles and moving more toward Woodwick.,Follow-up- I see someone didn't find my review helpful. Not sure how I can be more informative although that is mine & many others opinion. I purchased another similar Yankee this holiday season & it again has very little scent compared to the Woodwick Balsam Fir. No comparison in really. I mailed out Woodwick's this holiday season. No more Yankee's for me.

I blew it out and I'm going to relight it later.  A friend told me that sometimes the candles are old and they won't smell as much I don't know if that's true and how do you know if it's old???,I must have been mistaken but I thought Yankee candles come with three wicks, maybe they have a larger one, guess I have to check it out.,Hopefully when I relight it I will get the aroma Yankee candles are known for.

  The perfect candle for the holidays.  The wonderful balsam scent and long lasting, slow burn made this a great candle to light everyday throughout our holiday season.  I will certainly purchase another one next year along with a cinnamon scented one to compliment this one.

David Filmer,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Balsam & Cedar,Pattern Name: Candle",5.0 out of 5 stars,Part of my family's holiday tradition,"
  We've tried every Yankee pine scented candle and this one is everyone's favorite (by a wide margin).  It's the balsam that sets this apart.  You may have heard of Balm of Gilead (it is mentioned in the Bible).  That's made from balsam, and balsam has been a highly prized fragrance for eons.  The pine scent does not resemble the smell of cedar boards - it's more like douglas fir.  One candle will give a fresh scent to a large living/dining area and adjoining kitchen, and last at least four weeks of fairly regular use. This is always part of my family's holiday tradition.

Snow,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Balsam & Cedar,Pattern Name: Candle",3.0 out of 5 stars,Decent Woodsy smell,"
  This is a strong scent that I use to cover up mild cigarette smoke and a musky attic smell.  I do recommend it but it is not as natural as I was expecting and does smell the same as the old candle smell from the 70's and 80's, which is older (but not bad).  It is the only yankee candle that works immediately however and it lasts longer than the smoke eaters I have tried; and one single wick fills my entire studio apartment.  A nice/newer alternative is yankee's Autumn Leaves which smells similar (but is orange).

  Smelled like Christmas but not too astringent. It was a great substitute for not having a tree in a limited space. Gave the place a great, cheery smell but without all the pine needles to clean up!

  I usually buy candles from the Yankee store at the mall but I moved to NYC a couple of years ago and I hate shopping here and I am sure I wouldn't be able to find these candles here in NYC.  Super fast shipping and excellent packaging.  Item as described and pictured.  I have been buying Yankee candles for years and I ONLY buy yankee candles.  They all smell WONDERFUL.  No other scented candle comes close to Yankee candles.  As soon as you light the candle it immediately starts to scent the room(s).  I only burn the candle for about 1 hour at a time and the scent stays in the room for quite some time.  Make sure you keep the wick cut short before you the light the candle.  This helps the candle to burn more efficiently and prevents black smoke burn-off.  This candle is perfect for people who have fake christmas trees because it smells just like a real tree, if not better than a real tree.  All of their scents are fantastic!  I highly recommend and I will be buying more in the future.

Pat B. (Michigan Resident),"Size: Large Jar,Style: Christmas Cookie,Pattern Name: Candle",5.0 out of 5 stars,All-Time Favorite!,"
  Christmas Cookie is a very subtle scent that smells like fresh sugar cookies baking in the oven. It's one of my all-time favorite candle scents from Yankee Candle. I actually burn Christmas Cookie scented candles all year long in my house! For some variety, I switch up the one I burn in the kitchen to McIntosh Apple or Buttercream, the other scents that I love. The reason I choose Yankee Candle over other brands is that they last longer and the fragrance is not overwhelming. Since they last longer, I can burn them for hours at a time and enjoy every minute! Now the scented Yankee Candles come in a variety of containers and sizes that appeal to all ages & decorating styles!

Paul Jones,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Christmas Cookie,Pattern Name: Candle",3.0 out of 5 stars,Overrated and Overpriced,"
  Yankee Candles in my opinion are overrated and overpriced.  I ordered one of the larger size along with three of the same size Village Candles.  The Yankee Candle did not come in its own custom box as did the Village candle.  In addition, the single wick does not burn as efficiently and cleanly as the Village Candle.  I am glad I found an alternative.

  I bought this for $10.99!  What a steal!  I use Warm Luxe Cashmere as my plugin air freshener.  Christmas Cookie enhances that vanilla tone and makes the house smell wonderful.  It's a different kind of vanilla smell, unlike those cheap candles and air fresheners.  It just smells so good!  Will definitely buy again!

AndoverMom,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Balsam & Cedar,Pattern Name: Candle",3.0 out of 5 stars,Skimpy scent,"
  Great price but I am disappointed with the amount of scent. I had a Colonial candle, also a tree scent, and it was so powerful it made my whole kitchen and family room smell like a freshly cut Christmas tree. I bought two of the Yankee candles when the Colonial candle was running out  and I ended up needing them both.  I was going to use one as a gift but I needed it and still don't get the same level of scent.,Not sure if these were a special Amazon purchase, but the money I saved would have better used with a Colonial or wait until after Christmas and buy the candles 1/2 at Yankee. Don't remember where I got the other candle or the cost but I may be a convert to Colonial.

  Don't buy this candle.  I have to put my nose up to the candle to smell it.  Had to blow it out because people would bend over the flame to smell the fragrance and I was afraid their hair would catch on fire.  I thought it was a brand name, therefore, it would be a good candle.  No way... I would hesitate to buy any candle by this brand.

  I put up an artificial Christmas tree and missed the tree smell that fills the house. Although this candle definitely smells like a Christmas tree, it's way too strong. I normally love Yankee Candles, and I'd like this one, except that the odor is too overwhelming.

Ankur,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Balsam & Cedar,Pattern Name: Candle",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not Impressed with this Product,"
  Yankee Candle has not impressed me at all. They have become a powerful name in the candle industry but there candles are not very good. This candle was suppose to have that  ""christmas tree scent."" I found that the candle emitted a very light(weak) scent and I can barely smell the scent even when putting the candle to my nose. Very disappointed, not a good candle for the price.

PC Nut,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Christmas Cookie,Pattern Name: Candle",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Fot those wondering why Yankee Candles seem weak these days, there is a reason...they sold out.","
  I was a long time Yankee Candle buyer since the early 2000s through 2017. I used to buy them in the mall and stock up when they had the buy one get one free deals. My first hint something was wrong was when I bought holiday themed ones during 2016. They just didn't have the same ""throw"" even though I was buying some of the same scents. I thought it a fluke until 2017 holiday season and I knew something was not right. I bought a couple more last holiday season 2019 and they still sucked. I had some unopened ones from 2013 or so and fired one up in another room for comparison. Sure enough, the 2013 jar lit up the room in scent as we all were used to whereas these newer ones were just dead. Bear in mind that was a six year old candle! So, I did some research. You are far from alone if you noticed there isn't the strong ""throw"" of scent the original Yankee Candles had. Here's what one member of a candle website review forum said what's going on in his/her March 2020 post:,""A friend of mine worked at Yankee candles production facility the last 5 years and tells me that a lot has changed. When he started there was hardly any mineral oil used, now its about 40% of each candle. He says its just filler, so they don’t have to use as much wax. They keep upping the % of mineral oil as its a cheap filler and lets them make more per candle. He also says they have changed to a much cheaper scent. They actually have to use more per candle as its so weak, but its way cheaper than the older scent. He says constant cost cutting measures like this are implemented all the time to up the profits per candle. It’s far from the old Yankee Candle."",^^And there you have it. The new management of Yankee Candle is chasing profits over quality. Like many others, I have found MUCH better value in generic grocery store candles. Such a shame, but that's the beauty of capitalism for you. Someone fails, another fills the void instead of a socialist government telling you that you only have one option that they decide for you.

  I'm writing a review to confirm that this year's batch of balsam & cedar candles are duds.  I bought mine directly from Yankee Candle, not through Amazon, and mine is lacking the Christmas tree scent of previous years too, so it's not a matter of Amazon having a knock-off.  It seems to me that Yankee Candle has tried to save on production costs by cutting back on the amount of essential oil they're using.  So disappointing!  I'm so sick of companies that boost their profit by decreasing their product quality but keeping the price the same (or even higher).  Buyer beware.

  This is hands-down the best Yankee candle and I own like 40. My review on the Yankee website what's that it smells kind of like giving your 3rd grade teacher a hug  during Christmas time LOL. I really wasn't a fan of the other Christmas scents like ""all is bright"" or holiday lights (good but not strong enough and kind of perfumy). but this is totally different, I wouldn't say it has a marshmallow scent but it is very soft cozy scent, combined with the most subtle pine on Earth I would not know it was pine unless I read the description, I think it has kind of like a milky vanillaish base. it's really hard to describe but it reminds me of my third grade teacher who was my favorite person on Earth. So comforting but not at all perfumey. Just straight comfort. Great for any day any time. I'll have to buy like 10 more during the sale. Please never discontinued.. has medium throw.

  Do you want your house black? Because this will turn your house black.,I noticed dirt all over a large jug of water in the kitchen. I rinsed it off and the next day there was black all over the water jug again. What the heck?,Later, I noticed the Yankee candle in the kitchen had gone out so I went to relight it. There was dark sooty crap all over the inside of the glass. Huh. That's strange. Then I noticed dark sooty crap all over my coffee mug. Then the cupboards. The counters. My shoes. WTF. Then I looked up. The ceiling and everything within a 10 foot radius has a black hue to it. Everyone in the house has also developed a cough. I'm pretty sure this is the culprit. Did something happen to Yankee Candle??? Were they bought out by a cheaper company?? Are they trying to maximize profits by using sub-par ingredients and filling our house with cancer causing chemicals?? I wouldn't be surprised to see a class-action lawsuit soon.,***EDIT*** Jeez.

  I purchased this candle and scent based on other reviewers who have reported a wonderful pine fragrance but I must have gotten a defective product because there is practically NO throw. I have to stand over the candle to get a whiff of any kind of fragrance. Initially when we lit this candle, we could smell it - it was probably the wax coating on the wick that gave off the fragrance but after that, no scent. I had it burning for a good two hours but still no scent. Yankee Candle brand is usually very good, but not this particular product.

  I like most all of the larger candles from Yankee Candle, but I don't really love this one. Even though the scent is somewhat reminiscent of apples and cinnamon, to me it smells a little too artificial. When I first lit it and later came back into the room I couldn't recognize the scent and couldn't connect it with the candle. Maybe it's the walnut and maple that throws it off, but either way, it's not my favorite. I like it, but not as much as the other Yankee Candle fragrances.,As I wrote in another review, we've tried different brands of fragrance candles and none of them even come close to the Yankee Candles.

Moo,,3.0 out of 5 stars,It feels kinda cheap,"
  I feel like these candles used to be a lot more potent and last much longer 10 years ago. This is a fantastic scent, but the candle will only fill a small room with a hint of the essence. There are air pockets in the wax which make it glisten and look posh, but that removes what I'm guessing is 10%+ of the volume that could be taken up by solid product. I'm sure it has something to do with the way it's designed to melt and disperse the scent in the large jar, but that's a problem for Engineering. At this point, it's more of a status symbol of how homey your living room is than a functioning scented candle

  One of my favorite scents I like to use during the holidays; A nice pine like and berry scent with a good throw to it. A great candle if you like to use other than a straight pine or fir scent.,Suggestions,Issue: Jar candles that don't burn evenly.,Purchase (available online) waxed candle wicks with the base 6-8"" in length and a 12"" long drill bit around 11/64,Drill a hole offset of the main candle wick about 3/4-1"" clear to the bottom of jar. Detach base of purchased 6"" wick and insert into drilled hole and trim to same length as original wick; now you have a 2 wick candle which will burn more evenly.,Suggestion,When your jar candles wick has expired and there is that little bit of wax left. Place Jar on oven burner and melt wax over low-med heat. When melted remove old wick base with a fork and place,another wick as mentioned above but do not detach from base. place in melted wax and you have a makings of a new candle and just melt wax from other used candles and pour into jar candle with the new wick. after about 6 + used candles you will have a new candle. I keep my fall and pine- Christmas candles separate.

  I purchased 6 large candles at one of their Mall stores.  The candles were offered “buy one get one free” sale.  I was so disappointed that only 1 of the 6 candles purchased had any scent even though they were burning for hours.  The best scented candle was “Chocolate Cake”.  What has happened to Yankee Candle????  Maybe too many companies have purchased it in the past few years and are trying to rest on the laurels of the once top scented candle while cutting corners for profit making.  The same thing happened to Elizabeth Arden’s “Red Door” perfume once the Arden company was purchased and does anyone recall the lovely fragrance, “White Shoulders”?  The scent is not recognizable any longer.

BuffyBuff,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Home For The Holidays,Pattern Name: Candle",5.0 out of 5 stars,Baked goods & fireplace!,"
  My 2nd favorite Holiday scent (1st being Christmas Wish) from Yankee Candle.  I have been buying this scent for years, typically it is my pre-Christmas (November-ish) scent as it not quite Christmas-y to me but definitely not your ordinary Autumn scent.  The first thing you smell is the cinnamon, it is very strong (which I like -- I feel spicy scents are excellent at removing odors from the air, sweet scents just hang around too much and get nauseating) but so nice.  Then you smell what is stated as balsam but to me it is a fireplace/burning wood fragrance.  It is one of the combination scents (which I love) of Yankee's that I really find comforting -- I like the scents that you can't really figure out what you are smelling but the effect is wonderful.  To me, this fragrance is all about Thanksgiving -- before I light up the Christmas Wish.

  Buyer beware-if you are able to get a candle that actually emits a scent (has a ""throw"") while burning, then lucky you.  But the quality of YC has gone steadily downhill for the last few years so don't be surprised if its basically has no scent.  What made me ""retire"" from purchasing YC is that I received a number of candles on a large order that weren't even filled up to the top-they didn't even get filled to the top of the label!  That is VERY poor quality control and a major rip off considering the price.  There are now many copy cat candle manufacturers that have just as fragrant candles and are a lot more reasonably priced-and I'm more than willing to give them a try.

  I tend to avoid YC food candles; why? They are so realistic that they make my sweet tooth go into hyper drive and this on is no exception. Smells like fresh baked cookies,This has a nice sweet fragrance that will appeal to most.,Suggestions,Issue: Jar candles that don't burn evenly.,Purchase (available online) waxed candle wicks with the base 6-8"" in length and a 12"" long drill bit around 11/64,Drill a hole offset of the main candle wick about 3/4-1"" clear to the bottom of jar. Detach base of purchased 6"" wick and insert into drilled hole and trim to same length as original wick; now you have a 2 wick candle which will burn more evenly.,Suggestion,When your jar candles wick has expired and there is that little bit of wax left. Place Jar on oven burner and melt wax over low-med heat. When melted remove old wick base with a fork and place,another wick as mentioned above but do not detach from base. place in melted wax and you have a makings of a new candle and just melt wax from other used candles and pour into jar candle with the new wick. after about 6 + used candles you will have a new candle. I keep my fall and pine- Christmas candles separate.

Eusebius,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Red Apple Wreath,Pattern Name: Candle",3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like it, but it's not my favorite. Scent is a little too artificial","
  I like most all of the 22-ounce candles from Yankee Candle, but I don't really love this one. Even though the scent is somewhat reminiscent of apples and cinnamon, to me it smells a little too artificial.  When I first lit it and later came back into the room I couldn't recognize the scent and couldn't connect it with the candle.  Maybe it's the walnut and maple that throws it off, but either way, it's not my favorite. I like it, but not as much as the other Yankee Candle fragrances.,As I wrote in another review, we've tried different brands of fragrance candles and none of them even come close to the Yankee Candles. They are long lasting and fragrant - the scent is even and continuous right down to the bottom of the candle. Other cheaper brands don't last ¼ the time or have ¼ the scent and actually turn out to be more expensive than a Yankee Candle because of this.

Zolton,"Size: Large Jar,Style: Mistletoe,Pattern Name: Candle",4.0 out of 5 stars,It's Hit or Mistletoe,"
  I'm not a big Christmas guy. If I find myself sitting on the knee of some fat bearded guy at the mall, telling him what I wish for most and whether I've been a naughty boy, then I've got a whole world of problems I really don't want to think about.,Still, 'tis the season. So at my wife's insistence, I'm making an effort to find the ""Christmas spirit"" this year. Where by ""find"", of course I mean ""buy"".,Mistletoe is an old Christmas standby, and romantic to boot. But who wants some hacked-off bit of poisonous plant looming over their doorway? Better, I thought, to bring the tradition home in candle form. I'm not usually so keen on the aromas of things that end in 'toe', but I have to say, this candle smells really nice and piney fresh.,As mistletoe, it's another story. I tried angling for a smooch from my sweetie the other day, lifting the candle above our heads in the established mistletoe tradition. Sadly, the candle is rather heavy, and when I leaned in for a peck I accidentally dropped it on my own head. I thought I was getting a kiss, and instead I wound up on the floor bleeding from a head wound and trying to remember the name of the letter that comes after 'G'. And that doesn't spell ""Christmas"" in my book.,More like ""junior prom"", from what I can recall. At least that came with a boutonniere and a flask full of Boone's Farm. Now all I've got is memory loss and this smelly green candle.

  A little bit on the expensive side at $25. I managed to pick up the large Christmas Cookie for $4.87 at jCpenny with my $15 complimentary coupon they give me a few times a year for being a card holder. I will say this candle smells pretty darn good. You have to let the candle burn for a good hour when you first light it for the first time to enjoy it's aroma. When you relight it later the aroma kicks in pretty quick. This is a great candle to have burning around Christmas time, you have the family over rocking the turtle necks and the egg nog going you must have this candle burning in the background..

  It smells exactly as an old-fashioned Christmas cookie does baking- buttery, sweet & warm. I like it on a hall table that's right outside my kitchen- it greets me and my guests so nicely. It is a comfy scent. If the fragrance isn't strong, it may be that you got an older candle, because this is actually quite fragrant, even in a large space. It smells a lot like YC's Buttercream and Vanilla Cookie scents. All are interchangeable. The large burns for many, many days. I'd say 60-100 hours.

Alice,"Size: Medium Jar Candle,Style: All is Bright,Pattern Name: Candle",,,"
  I bought the All is Bright Yankee Candle as a gift for my friend and her husband for Christmas as they'd been through a rough time. Sort of a symbolism gift that they made it through the other side and 'all is bright' again.,Yankee Candles are a bit on the pricier side, but the medium jar lasts a decent amount of time and the smell fills the room so I feel like it makes up for it.,One thing I would say is if you buy a medium/large jar, make sure you have the time to burn it for a decent period of time so the melted wax can even out. Otherwise the candle won't melt properly which can be a bit wasteful (if this happens when it's completely burnt out, I usually melt down the remaining wax myself and create another candle with other waxs).,I would recommend this candle for people who like refreshing, light scents.

  Personally I've never tried this candle before I purchased it from Amazon directly so I thought for the price I would give it a go this Holiday season;  I started burning it two weeks ago and I have to say the smell is rather strong (not over powering but pleasantly strong).

  Ich bin ein großer Fan der Yankee Candle Produkte und kann auch hier nichts anderes als 5 Sterne vergeben. Christmas Eve ist mein absoluter Lieblingsduft. Schon in der Vorweihnachtszeit macht er Lust auf Heilig Abend, denn er ist sehr festlich und weich. Die Brenndauer der Kerze entspricht sehr genau der vom Hersteller angegebenen. Sie rußt kaum und brennt schön gleichmäßig ab. Die Qualität ist wie eigentlich immer bei YC sehr gut. Insgesamt ein toller Weihnachtdsduft, den ich sicher nicht zum letzten Mal gekauft habe und der sich auch toll als Geschenk eignet.

  Yankee Candles provide good value in their mid market position, with attractive lidded jars and pleasant fragrances, although I would urge doing some in-store sniffing before purchase where possible to check the smell is to your taste.,For best burning experience, keep the wick trimmed to no more than 3mm and use a candle snuffer to extinguish as that helps prevent the wax going everywhere.,This is an attractively scented candle, perfect for dinner table, lounge, bedroom and as a secret Santa/stocking. The lid helps keep the dust off between burnings although this one smells so nice it is unlikely to get a chance to accumulate dust in this house.

  These cannot be legitimate Yankee candles.

  Ich bin ein großer Fan der Yankee Candle Produkte und kann auch für diese Kerze nichts anderes als 5 Sterne vergben. All is bright ist einer meiner Lieblingsdüfte: warm, ohne zu süß zu sein und weihnachtlich ohne gleich mit der typisch holzigen Zimt-Note anzukommen. Die Brenndauer entspricht der angegeben auf der Kerze ziemlich genau. Die Kerze rußt kaum und brennt schön gleichmäßig ab. Insgesamt eine tolle Kerze, die ich jederzeit wieder kaufen würde.

  I honestly think that this brand is making the best candles. If you're looking for nice scent in all over the house I can truly recommend it.

  Kam schnell, gut verpackt und heil an.,Yankee Candles, die sie kennen lieben sie, die sie nicht kennen, haben etwas versäumt.,Vorab: Der Preis ist gerechtfertigt.,Diesmal habe ich mich für Christmas Magic im mittleren Jar entschieden und nicht bereut. Der Duft ist angenehm und nicht aufdringlich, dennoch wahrnehmbar.,Kopfnote: Bergamotte, Eukalyptus, Mandarine.,Herznote: Kiefernnadeln, Tannenharz, Weihrauch.,Basisnote: Birke, Zedernholz.,Ein festlicher Duft für die Weihnachtszeit.,Nicht vergessen: Vor dem Anzünden immer den Docht kürzen und so lange brennen lassen bis die oberste Wachsschicht komplett geschmolzen ist. Dann hat man lange Freude damit, denn die Kerzen halten sehr lange.,Kaufempfehlung!

  Tolle Kerze in gewohnter YC-Qualität. Mit der richtigen Pflege (Docht vor jedem Anzünden kürzen und so lange brennen lassen, bis oberster Rand flüssig ist) brennen diese Kerzen lange und gleichmäßig ab ohne zu rußen.,Dieser Duft war neu für mich und ich habe den Kauf nicht bereut. Für mich ein gelungener Duft, einer der besten Düfte die ich bis jetzt hatte - und ich habe schon so einige ausprobiert. Ich kann ihn schwer beschreiben, für mich riecht er blumig und leicht süß, ohne aufdringlich oder billig zu wirken. Ein wirklich festlicher Duft.,Wer Duftkerzen mag hat sein Geld in diese Kerze gut investiert. Jeden Cent wert!

Unica nota negativa il cratere che si è formato nel centro, nonostante l'abbia fatta bruciare per ore ogni volta. Alla fine mi sono arresa, l' ho ""livellata"" manualmente togliendo la cera che non riusciva a sciogliersi. In questo modo però ho certamente diminuita di qualche ora la sua durata. Peccato!

Yannick,"Size: Large Jar Candle,Style: All is Bright,Pattern Name: Candle",,,"
  Ich hatte mir unter dem Duft ""All is Bright"" eigentlich etwas anderes vorgestellt. Für mich roch die Kerze leider gar nicht nach der dunklen Jahreszeit oder Vorweihnachtszeit. Es hatte eher etwas von einer ""normalen"" Duftkerze oder Duftstäbchen die man fürs Gäste-WC beim Drogeriemarkt um die Ecke kauft. Also meiner Meinung nach kein Geruch der 25€ wert ist! Da ist zum Beispiel ""Red Apple Wreath"" oder ""Snow in Love"" deutlich stimmiger und hochwertiger von der Duftmischung.,Ich gebe trotzdem 4 von 5 Sternen, da ich ein großer Fan der Yankee Candles bin und es sehr, sehr hochwertige Duftkerzen sind!

  Fra le tante Yankee candle che ho regalato a mia moglie nel corso degli anni questa è la mia preferita. Il profumo che emana si sposa molto bene al periodo Natalizio ma in generale di festa. L'unico neo è il solito fatto che la candela tende a consumarsi nella parte centrale lasciando un solco che non è particolarmente bello da vedere. L'unico modo per risolvere è quello di mettere in parità manualmente la base della candela ma facendo in questo modo ovviamente andremo ad intaccare quella che è la durata del prodotto. In ogni caso sono piccolezze per un regalo unico che nel mio caso è sempre stato di gradimento verso la persona a cui l'ho donato e sicuramente contribuisce a rendere più accogliente l'ambiente in cui la si decide di accendere.

  Zuerst habe ich die YC in dieser Duftrichtung (und überhaupt das erste Mal so eine teure Duftkerze) als Votivkerze getestet. Der Duft hat mich so umgehauen, dass ich kurze Zeit später, nach einigen Überlegungen (22€ für eine KERZE sind ja nun wirklich nicht wenig, absolutes Luxusgut) dann die große 623g Version mir zulegte. Sie brennt wunderbar ab, verteilt ein absolut fantastischen Duft im ganzen Raum und brennt vor allem sehr sehr lange! Habe sie nun seit ca. 2 Monaten und ca. 3x die Woche für einige Stunden (4+) brennen und ich bin nun etwa bei der Hälfte angelangt. Den Duft nach frisch gebackenen Macaron, wunderschön süßlich, fand ich so toll, dass ich diese Kerze auch schon verschenkt habe.

  Qualità impeccabile yankee. Arrivata imballata benissimo e al 100 per cento originale. Come profumazione è veramente una delle migliori che io abbia mai avuto. Perfetta come profumazione per chi ama le note agrumate ma anche con retrogusto di vaniglia. Non è affatto stucchevole ma molto frizzantina. L'immagine è molto carina perfetta per le feste e non solo. L'odore si sente molto bene se accesa per almeno un'ora ,profuma la stanza anche abbastanza grande. La consiglio. Yankee è sempre una garanzia. L'ho pagata 20 euro in sconto e ne vale veramente la pena.,Aggiornamento.,Dopo averla accesa molte molte ore ,ancora è a poco meno della metà.  È veramente uno dei profumi migliori che io abbia mai avuto. Ne ho altre tre ma questa è imbattibile. Delicata ma persistente al punto giusto ed emana odore quasi subito da appena si accende.

  I think this candle is  overpriced for what you receive. The traditional glass container is nice, but there is not a strong scent from this candle. I had it burning all day, and each time any guest arrived, they could not really smell the scent. I purchased this brand because I heard good things about them, but honestly I can find much nicer candles with plenty of the natural scent oils. I really hate leaving negative feedback but I wouldn't purchase this brand again.

  Let me start by saying that I have been a yankee candle lover for two decades and have bought more candles than I could ever count....theses DO NOT smell like yankee candles!!!!!,So angry to spend that kind of money on what should be a strong scented candle, only to get a candle with next to zero scent!,I just bought the Christmas Cookie from their store in the states and it smells exactly like it should.,Bottom line: dont waste your money here and by it from the store!

  Tengo varias velas de esta marca, la compré pensando que olerla a bosque, pero que decepción! Ni encendida huele a nada! Y tiene un ligero aroma a EUCALIPTO y NO a Cedro. De cualquier manera ni siquiera se distingue.
